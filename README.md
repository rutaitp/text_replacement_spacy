Project playing with POS replacement using [spacy.io POS Tagging](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/pos-tagging).

In the example original text is Inauguration speech of Donald Trump, replacement text: script of Frankenstein.

The script is scraped using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) from [IMSDB](http://www.imsdb.com/genre/Sci-Fi) site.
